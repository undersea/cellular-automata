* What is cellular automata (brief as possible)
* Using Cellular Automata as a classifier
** Explore the use of cellular automata as a means of data mining, specifically classification.
** Gives resonable generalisation behaviour as an emergent property
* What are its strengths and weaknesses as a classifier
** Low bias
** effective general classification, similar to those produced by complex data mining models, through the collective behaviour of simple cells
** makes pure local decisions based upon information from only its immediate neighbours
** Uses little data
** Is robust in the face of noise
* How do they do it
** Instance based learning
** Cells represent portions of instance space
** organised and connected according to attribute value ranges
*** These being things like x and y vectors with x representing say height and y representing weight
*** The values must be in form of integers otherwise can't be mapped into a vector space
** Instance space in form of a multidimensional grid
** Grid is seeded with training data
** CA is run until convergence
*** Organise themselves into regions of similar class assignemt
** CA uses a simple voting system locally that reduces entropy
*** Sets the cells value according to the values of its neighbourhood, majority wins
*** Uses Von Neumann neighbourhood 
**** as is linear in number of dimensions of the namespace (for each dimension you get 2 neighbours)
**** scales well as a result
