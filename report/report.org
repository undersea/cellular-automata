* What is cellular automata (brief as possible)
* Using Cellular Automata as a classifier
** Explore the use of cellular automata as a means of data mining, specifically classification.
** Gives resonable generalisation behaviour as an emergent property
* What are its strengths and weaknesses as a classifier
** Low bias
** effective general classification, similar to those produced by complex data mining models, through the collective behaviour of simple cells
** makes pure local decisions based upon information from only its immediate neighbours
** Uses little data
** Is robust in the face of noise
* How do they do it
** 
* Results from what they actually implemented (2d)
* Multidimensional data mining (> 2d)
** Grid definition
** Grid size
** Convergence
* Related work
* Discussion


* Notes
