* Introduction
 - Data mining (Classification)
 - Purpose is to show that cellular automata can be used as a
   clustering tool
* Clustering and Classification tool
 - Emergent behaviour
 - Less error prone
 - Low-bias and Self organising
* The approach
+ Uses a majority voting system
+ Grid size and dimensions determined by predicates used
+ It is run until convergence happens
  - This is achieved when all cells are assigned a class

* My implementation
 * Written in C++ using the STL
 * The process
   - Define a grid
     + Predicates must be turned into integers
   - Populate with training data
   - Run until finished
   - Test with test data
* Findings
 + In general my data does seem to support Fawcett's hypothesis
 + Does not exactly match up with Fawcett's results

* Explanation/Evaluation
 + Inconsistencies between my results and Fawcett's
   + Maybe because of a lack of specific information
 + The process can take a long time
 + Memory is the bottleneck

* Conclusions
 - Cellular automata can be used as a clustering and classification
   tool
